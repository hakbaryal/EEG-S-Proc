# EEG-S-Proc

EEG-S-Proc is an open source software created through the MATLAB r2016b application designer. The program is used to compare the EEG synchronizations of different groups.
You can trim the EEG recordings and filter them with a bandpass filter and stationary wavelet transforms.
You can observe the phase synchronization results in the Scull map and the global area synchronization results in the graphs.
Finally, you can compare the results from the statistics section of the program.
